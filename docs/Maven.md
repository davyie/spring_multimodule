What happens when aggregating multi module project? 
- We have a parent pom which contains dependencies. This is such that all sub modules should have the necessary dependencies and common versions of the dependencies. 
Furthermore, we get a central place to build all submodules. 
It helps us build the modules in correct order. 
It facilitates versioning because we can change it from a central point.
